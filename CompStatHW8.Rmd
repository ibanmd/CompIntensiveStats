# Question 1
Suppose that $y$ is a single observation from a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$.  

**a) Find the MLE of $\mathbf{p}$.**  

**b) Assume the prior distribution of $\mathbf{p}$ is $\mathbf{Beta(a, b)}$ with $\mathbf{0<p<1}$.  Find the Bayes estimator of $\mathbf{p}$.**  

# Question 2
Suppose that $x_1,...x_n$ is a random sample from a normal distribution $N(\theta, \sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^2$ is known.

**a) Find the MLE of $\mathbf{\theta}$.**  

**b) Assume the prior distribution of $\mathbf{\theta}$ is $\mathbf{N(\theta_0, \sigma_0^2)}$.  Find the Bayes estimator of $\mathbf{\theta}$.**
