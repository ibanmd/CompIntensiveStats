# Question
10 observations are selected from a bivariate normal distribution and two values are missing.  Find the MLE for $(\mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma_{11}, \sigma_{12}, \sigma_{22})$.

| Variable 1 | 8  | 11 | 16 | 18 | 6  | 4 | 20 | 25 | 9 | 13 |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|---|----|----|---|----|
| Variable 2 | 10 | 14 | 16 | 15 | 20 | 4 | 18 | 22 | ? | ?  |

## Answer
```{r echo=FALSE}
V1 <- c(8, 11, 16, 18, 6, 4, 20, 25, 9, 13)
V2 <- c(10, 14, 16, 15, 20, 4, 18, 22, 0, 0)
plot(V2 ~ V1)
```
